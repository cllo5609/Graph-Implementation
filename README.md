# Graph-Implementation

## Undirected Graph

## Directed Graph
A class to implement a directed graph. Vertices and their connected vertices are stored using an
adjacency matrix in the form of a list. The class contains methods for adding and removing edges and vertexes,
checking the graph for valid paths, cycles, performs depth-first searches and breadth-first, and performs
Dijkstra's Algorithm to find the shortest cost/distance path in the graph.
